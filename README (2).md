# Enhanced Brain Tumor Segmentation with U-Net: A Deep Learning Approach


This project presents a Machine Learning for brain tumor segmentation using MRI scans. Built on a robust UNet architecture, the app processes uploaded MRI images, identifies tumor regions with high accuracy, and overlays the segmented area on the original image for visualization.

By leveraging advanced data augmentation techniques and optimizing with a Dice-BCE loss function, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy and efficiency, promising significant advancements in medical image analysis.
